    <p>Computer memory  is the electronic storage space within a computer system where commands and data are stored, either temporarily or permanently. It makes it possible for the computer to store information, access it quickly, and perform tasks efficiently. Memory is essential to a computer's operation.<br> It stores the data and commands
         needed for operations and acts as the workspace for the processor. </p>
         <p class="big">Computer memory types can generally categorized into two broad category.  
            These are internal memory and external memory.  Internal memory is a type of memory that CPU can access directly and rapidly.
             It stores data and instructions that computer use actively during processing time.  External memory is also known as secondary storage. 
              It is refers to non-volatile data storage devices that are not part of the computer’s main, internal hardware. 
            It is used to store permanent storage of programs, applications, and files that cannot be directly accessed by the CPU.</p>
            <p id="special">Registers are very high-speed storage areas located inside the CPU. 
                After CPU gets the data and instructions from the cache or RAM, the data and instructions are moved to the registers for processing. 
                Registers are manipulated directly by the control unit of CPU during instruction execution. </p>
